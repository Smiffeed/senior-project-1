# Senior Project I: Thai Word Censor Automation

This project aims to create an automated system for censoring Thai profanity in videos using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and audio waveform analysis.

## Project Overview

The system processes video files to detect and censor Thai profanity in audio components.

## First approach

1. Data Collection:
   - Gather a large dataset of Thai audio samples containing both clean and profane speech.
   - Ensure the dataset is diverse and representative of different speakers, accents, and audio qualities.
2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Convert audio files to a consistent format (e.g., WAV) and sample rate.
   - Extract audio features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or spectrograms from the waveforms. (Not success doing it)
3. Labeling:
   - Annotate the dataset, marking the timestamps where profanity occurs. (0 non-profanity, 1 profanity)
   - Create a list of Thai profanity words to be censored.
4. Model Architecture:
   - Use a deep learning model suitable for audio processing, such as:
     - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
     - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTM or GRU
     - Transformer-based models
   - Or using Existing model: SpeechBrain, Wav2Vec 2.0, Keras Audio Classification Model.
5. Training:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Train the model to identify profanity in the audio samples.
6. Evaluation and Iteration:
   - Test the model on the test set and real-world samples.
   - Iterate and refine the model based on performance.
7. Post-processing:
   - Implement a method to censor or bleep out the identified profanity.

So, I am doing first one is waveform analysis approach which will detect word by word in audio format directly as you advised.
